# Neural Assisted Control
Using neural networks to efficiently compute optimal control policies.

A project to implemented data-driven control methods. An extension of the work performed in "Optimal Energy Shaping via Neural Approximators" by Massaroli et. al. The focus of this work is to extend the results of the paper from a single DOF pendulum to a multi-DOF system, namely a double pendulum.

Status:
- [x] Baseline implementation with the help of Torchdyn + tutorials recreating results of the paper.
- [x] Extraction of trajectories and animation of single-DOF pendulum
- [x] Cuda compatibility
- [ ] Extension to multi-DOF system(s)
